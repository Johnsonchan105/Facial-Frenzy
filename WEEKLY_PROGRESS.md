|     calee14     | Worked on calling each component of the whole program to ensure smooth gameplay                                                                 | Host backend on Pi                            | None         |
|                 | Implemented feature such that the user must first "log in" with their face (have it confirmed by Gretchen's model) before allowing them to play | Conduct more testing                          |              |
|                 | Called Johnson's emotion recognition game after user is logged in                                                                               |                                               |              |
|   gretchenlam   | Implemented feature that allows user to dynamically add themselves to known faces if they are initially Unknown                                 | Ensure seamless face recognition              | None         |
|                 | Implemented feature that ensures program confirms user's face / identity for 3 seconds before returning their name                              | Debug any issues                              |              |
|                 | Prevented inaccurate guesses by labeling user as Unknown if no consistent recognition can be made within 3 seconds                              | Conduct more testing with unrecognized users  |              |
|                 | Upped the face match threshold and confidence value measurements to ensure higher accuracy and less guessing                                    |                                               |              |
| Johnsonchan105 | Worked on accuracy of emotion recognition model significantly                                                                                   | Add more features to the game, such as levels | None         |
|                 | Began building the actual game, which generates a random emotion that the user must match within 5 seconds                                      | Modify game                                   |              |
