# expresso
Our vision for our Raspberry Pi expression game project is to create an engaging and interactive experience in which players' emotions shape the gameplay. We are using several devices to create a facial recognition game where the player has to make the expression specified by the computer. Utilizing OpenCV, a facial expression detection library, and a laptop and webcam, our game will enable players to communicate, connect, and express themselves in a fun way. Our design implementation will seamlessly integrate the Raspberry Pi, providing an endpoint and accessible platform for players to share their emotions through expressive play. Future features we plan to include are utilizing an Amazon Echo dot to interact with the raspberry pi and share the results of the gameplay.
